			<h1>Who am I?</h1>
              <p>
	              My name is Dayana. I was born on May 23, 2006. I have changed three schools. At the moment I study at Nazarbayev Intellectual School and live in a dormitory. I was born in Ekibastuz, but I live in Pavlodar. 
              </p>
              <p>
              	Now I'm studying in the 9th grade, I got interested in programming in the 7th grade. It started with Olympiad programming in c++. But I'm lazy, so I did not pay much time to it. There was a quarantine period, so I relaxed. Now I spend more time on Visual Studio project. I started using it a 2 months ago. 
              </p>
              <p>
              	I learned about IT-school, and I saw new opportunities and motivation to keep working. I always want to learn something new, something more interesting. I decided not to lose and tried to enroll. Fortunately, I did and I did not regret it. I am interested in it and I hope that everything will end well.

				<h1>My hobbies</h1>
				<p>
					As I said earlier, I'm into programming, but it's not the only thing I like.
				</p>
				<p>
					I like playing volleyball. I've been close to sports since I was a kid. I play volleyball three times a week. Of course, you get very tired, but it's worth it. I used to do basketball, soccer, track and field. But my final choice was volleyball. I feel calm and good on the volleyball court.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my free time I like to read manga or watch anime. I've been watching anime since the fourth grade. Also, lately I've really enjoyed watching the Vampire Diaries series. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact, I've tried so many types of hobbies. Because I didn't want to sit still and always wanted to try something new, so I can do many different things.

			<h1>My goals</h1>
			<p>
				I think that you should always set goals for yourself, so that you have something to strive for. This is very important. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I want to start working in this field after I finish the course to have my own money. It's a good opportunity for self-actualization. In addition, it is good practice and filling out a portfolio.
			</p>
			<p>
				I want to go abroad to an IT university in the future. To work in this specialty online to travel. I really want to travel all over Europe.
